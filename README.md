## Dataset Info :
### DAWN (Detection in Adverse Weather Nature)
 dataset consists of real-world images collected under various adverse weather conditions. This dataset emphasizes a diverse traffic environment (urban, highway and freeway) as well as a rich variety of traffic flow. The DAWN dataset comprises a collection of 1000 images from real-traffic environments, which are divided into four sets of weather conditions: fog, snow, rain and sandstorms. The dataset is annotated with object bounding boxes for autonomous driving and video surveillance scenarios.
